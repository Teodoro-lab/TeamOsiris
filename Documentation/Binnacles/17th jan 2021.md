Today we could finish our high-fidelity prototype. I think we learned a lot today and recognize the effort that takes to realize all this iterations and finally get 
a well done work-product.

We last like 6 hours beginning with the first animations of some of the frames and organizing all the different components that we were using. At the end we organized 
all the frames that were used according to its functionality.

It's worth to mention that we are very happy and satisfied with the final result.
